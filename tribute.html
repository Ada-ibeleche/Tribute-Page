      A woman who has been an inspiration to many women all around the world.
      She is an american attorney and author served as the first lady of the
      untied states from <b>2009-2017</b>
      being married to former president Barack Obama. She grew up in Chicago's
      south shore neighbourhood with her older brother craig, attending Chicago
      Public schools and quickly joining gifted classes in elementary school. in
      New Jersey before attending Harvard Law School (J.D., 1988). Returning to
      Chicago, she took a job as a junior associate at Sidley & Austin (now
      Sidley Austin LLP), where she specialized in intellectual property law. In
      1989, while at the firm, she met Barack Obama, who had been hired as a
      summer associate. Seeking a more public-service-oriented career path, in
      1991 she became an assistant to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The
      following year she and Barack, then a community organizer, were married.
      From 1992 to 1993 Michelle was the assistant commissioner for the Chicago
      Department of Planning and Development, and in 1993 she founded the
      Chicago branch of Public Allies, a leadership-training program for young
      adults; she served as the branch’s executive director until 1996. Barack
      was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and that year Michelle became
      the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where
      she helped organize the school’s community outreach programs. In 2002 she
      became the executive director of community and external affairs for the
      University of Chicago. Two years later Barack was elected to the U.S.
      Senate and came to national prominence with a speech he gave on the final
      night of the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In 2005 she became vice
      president of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago
      Medical Center.

      When her husband announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic
      presidential nomination, Michelle took a prominent role in his campaign.
      She took leave from her position at the University of Chicago to devote
      herself more fully to campaigning while still maintaining time to care for
      her and Barack’s two young daughters. An adept speaker, she stumped
      extensively for her husband during the long Democratic primary race, and
      in June 2008 Barack became the party’s presumptive nominee. Michelle’s
      openness on the campaign trail and in interviews—she often humanized her
      husband by discussing his faults and implored observers not to “deify
      him”—endeared her to many. However, critics of her husband’s campaign took
      issue with some of her comments—such as when she remarked, while
      campaigning in Wisconsin in February 2008, that “for the first time in my
      adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.” Michelle later clarified
      her statement—saying that she meant to say that she was proud that
      Americans were eagerly engaging in the political process during the 2008
      election—and she continued to have an active role in her husband’s
      campaign. Indeed, campaign aides referred to her as “the closer,” for her
      persuasiveness on the stump among uncommitted voters who attended rallies.
      On November 4, 2008, Barack was elected 44th president of the United
      States, defeating Arizona Sen. John McCain; he took office on January 20,
      2009, and was reelected in 2012.

      As first lady, Michelle was involved in various causes, notably supporting
      military families and ending childhood obesity. In an effort to promote
      healthy eating, she planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the
      White House in 2009. She related her experiences with the project in the
      book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and
      Gardens Across America (2012). In addition to her work on such issues,
      Michelle also garnered attention for her fashion sense. During the 2016
      presidential race, Michelle supported the Democratic candidate, Hillary
      Clinton, and her speech during the party’s national convention drew
      widespread praise; noting the coarse tenor of the race, Michelle stated
      that “when they go low, we go high.” Clinton ultimately lost to Republican
      Donald Trump, who had r epeatedly and falsely suggested that Barack was
      not a U.S.-born citizen.
